This is a simple map application to demonstrate an error I am getting.
It is reproducible for me in Chrome Developer Tools with small screen emulators.
Browse to [error](http://aaronbutler.github.io/BasicMap/index_error.html)
to see the error and
[no error](http://aaronbutler.github.io/BasicMap/index.html)
to see a  lack thereof.
Unless this is peculiar to my machine/setup.
